### Structured data vs Unstructured dada

<dl>
<dt>Strucured data</dt>

<dd>This data is such that the values are already nicely given, usually as list <code> d[i] = ((x1,x2, x3, x4), y) </code> , and can be directly fed into the neural network</dd>


<dt>Unstructured data:

<dd> 
  Is pretty much that where the interest information is given in a latent form. Examples include a picture which includes a cat, an audio sample. The result (eg.: is it a cat?) isn't explicitly given in a way the computer can understand at first.
</dd>

  As vezes me pergunto se deep learning eh util para problemas em que uma solucao analitica eh inviavel ou algo assim. De certa forma, a interpretacao mais filosofica do que isso tudo eh n eh algo tao bem desenvolvido. Talvez eu deva pensar nisso depois
